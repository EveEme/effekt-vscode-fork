# Effekt Visual Studio Code

VSCode Language Server Client for the Effekt language.

## Getting Started
This extension is not currently published on the extension marketplace so you will have to install it manually in your extensions or run it from VSCode.

After installing the .vsix file, you need to set the path to the `effekt` binary. For Mac OS and Unix users this probably works out of the box after installing `effekt` with npm (that is, once the `effekt` command is in your path). For Windows users, you might need to set the path to `effekt.cmd`.

With this setup the extension should start the server when an Effekt file is opened.
